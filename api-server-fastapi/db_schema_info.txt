DATABASE SCHEMA UPDATE REQUIRED

The application has detected that your database schema is out of date.
This can happen when new features have been added to the application.

To update your database schema, please run the following command:

python reset_db.py

This will:
1. Back up your current database
2. Drop all existing tables
3. Create new tables with the updated schema

Note: This will reset all data in your database. If you have important data,
make sure to export it first or save the backup file created during the process.

After running the reset script, restart the API server to continue.
