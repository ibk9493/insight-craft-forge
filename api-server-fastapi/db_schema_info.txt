⚠️ DATABASE SCHEMA UPDATE REQUIRED ⚠️

The application has detected that your database schema is out of date.
This happens when new features have been added to the application that require database changes.

To update your database schema, please run the following command:

    python reset_db.py

This will:
1. Back up your current database
2. Drop all existing tables
3. Create new tables with the updated schema

IMPORTANT: This will reset all data in your database. If you have important data,
make sure to export it first or save the backup file created during the process.

After running the reset script, restart the API server to continue.

Common issues if you don't reset the database:
- "no such column: discussions.batch_id" errors
- "module 'schemas' has no attribute 'TaskState'" errors 
- Other schema-related errors
